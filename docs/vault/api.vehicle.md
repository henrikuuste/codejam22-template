## Overview
How do we specify vehicle model/contraints?

## Requirements and use cases
- We need to know the geometric properties of the vehicle
    - W, H, L
    - Changes in geometric properties (eg. payload in some position)
- We need to know the kinematic properties of the vehicle
    - vehicle kinematic constraints
        - Ackermann vs differential drive
        - Max velocity
        - Min turning radius
        - Max acceleration (positive and negative?)
        -  
- We need to know the dynamic properties of the vehicle?
    - E.g. If we want to compute energy cost
    - mass
    - inertia tensor?
